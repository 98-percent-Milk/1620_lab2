    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="images/me.jpg" alt="Picture of Me" width="500" height="500">
    <p>My name is Margad Bayarsaikhan Jantsan and I'm from Mongolia. I was born and raised in Ulaanbaatar, which is the capital of Mongolia, 
        and been living here in Canada since 2014. Before computer science I've taken general science and animation courses. 
        My hobbies include playing board games, video games and watching/listening video essay, documentary, podcast about internet mystery. 
        During my free time I make podcast with my friends. We usually discuss old commercial, music video, movie and sometimes crime.
